# TerraformAutomatedProvisioning

This is a project used to put in practice the knowledge gained from AWS and Terraform courses.

The general flow of the project is to create a network, an ec2 instance, provision it with a docker nginx container and create an AWS LoadBalancer to be able to access it from the internet.
